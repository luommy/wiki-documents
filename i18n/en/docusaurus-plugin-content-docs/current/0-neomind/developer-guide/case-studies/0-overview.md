# Case Studies Overview

This series is distinct from the [Extension API reference](../7-extension-development.md) and the [Dashboard Component API reference](../8-dashboard-component-dev.md) — those cover "what the API looks like and what it can do." This series focuses purely on **real engineering practice**: why a design was chosen, what pitfalls were hit, and how engineering standards are applied on the ground. Every case is selected from a real NeoMind ecosystem repository and audited by hand into a reproducible engineering write-up.

## The 7 Cases at a Glance

| # | Case | Type | Difficulty | Size | Key Value |
|---|------|------|-----------|------|-----------|
| 1 | weather-forecast-v2 | Data extension | Beginner | ~700 LOC | First-extension template (HTTP fetch + periodic metrics + React frontend) |
| 2 | yolo-device-inference | AI inference | Intermediate | ~1950 LOC | Lazy model loading / cross-session reuse / device camera integration |
| 3 | yolo-video-v2 | Streaming extension | Intermediate | ~3900 LOC | stream session + video-frame processing + VLM dashboard interop |
| 4 | onvif-bridge | Protocol bridge | Intermediate | ~2700 LOC | IP camera / standard protocol integration (parallels NeoEyes) |
| 5 | uink-rms-bridge | Protocol bridge | Intermediate | ~2250 LOC | Production-verified bridging |
| 6 | metric_card | Dashboard component | Beginner | ~400 LOC | Component template (value card + threshold / trend / unit) |
| 7 | ne101_camera | Extension + component interop | Flagship | ~2500-3500 LOC (8 sub-pages) | End-to-end deep tutorial |

## Reading Paths

Pick the shortest path for your role and goal:

- **Path 1 (Newcomer)**: 1 → 6 → 7 — Build intuition with the simplest extension and component, then tackle the end-to-end flagship case.
- **Path 2 (AI Engineer)**: 2 → 3 → 7 — From single-frame inference to video-stream processing, then full product integration.
- **Path 3 (Industrial Integrator)**: 4 → 5 → 7 — Two protocol-bridge cases as foundation, then a camera-grade product integration.
- **Path 4 (Component Developer)**: 6 → 7 → any extension case — Master the component paradigm first, then learn how to interop with extensions.

## Version Alignment Table

Case code is aligned with the source repository's release; the audit locks to a specific commit.

| Case | Source repo version | SDK version | Last audit |
|------|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 weather-forecast | v2.7.6 | SDK 0.6 | 2026-06-22 |
| 2 yolo-device-inference | v2.7.6 | SDK 0.6 | 2026-06-22 |
| 3 yolo-video-v2 | v2.7.6 | SDK 0.6 | 2026-06-22 |
| 4 onvif-bridge | v2.7.6 | SDK 0.6 | 2026-06-22 |
| 5 uink-rms-bridge | v2.7.6 | SDK 0.6 | 2026-06-22 |
| 6 metric_card | v1.7.0 | — | 2026-06-22 |
| 7 ne101_camera | v2.14.9 | — | 2026-06-22 |

A case audit is triggered when the source repository cuts a release (manual, not automated).

## Component Source Format Note

> NeoMind Dashboard Components ship as **hand-written IIFE JavaScript** — the file is named `bundle.js`, but it is **not a compiled artifact**; it is human-authored source.
>
> Conventions:
>
> - Runtime dependencies are injected via `var React = window.React` + `var jsx = window.jsxRuntime.jsx` (React / JSX runtime are provided by the host page).
> - Full comments and reasonable line breaks are preserved; readability is close to plain source code — you can read it directly without a source map.
> - Current sizes: `metric_card` is 352 lines, `ne101_camera` is 1972 lines.
>
> Therefore the "key code walkthroughs" in cases 6 / 7 point directly at specific line numbers in `bundle.js` — readers can open the source file and follow along.
