# Quick Start

## Product Overview

The NE300 series is a high-performance AI smart-camera lineup tailored for IoT deployments. The NE301 reference firmware exposes AI preview/debug, telemetry upload, system configuration, and other core capabilities. This guide helps you learn the feature set from a development-board perspective so you can validate hardware, firmware, and peripherals quickly.

The NE300-MB01 board is a low-power wireless platform that can capture still frames, live streams, and recorded video, while running on-device analytics. It is built around STMicroelectronics' STM32N657L0H3 (Arm® Cortex®-M55) with Wi-Fi 6 and BLE connectivity. OS04C10 and USB cameras can be used for imaging, with an optional Cat-1 modem for backhaul. The design targets low-power edge scenarios that need remote installation flexibility, photo capture, and on-board inference.

> Tips: Compared with the turnkey/boxed product documentation, this chapter focuses on developer workflows and feature-level tuning.

## Hardware Preparation

### What You Need

- NE300-MB01 development board
- Optional daughtercards (see [Hardware Components Overview](./1-hardware-guide/0-components-overview.md))

## Operating Guide

### Device Overview

Production samples ship with the standard firmware pre-flashed. Manual flashing isn't required unless the board fails to boot—see the system flashing guide if needed.

### Connecting the Board

**Key notes**

1. Power via the USB Type-C port (≥5 V / 1 A)
2. All headers feature keyed orientation
3. A 115200 bps debug UART is reserved on the board

Refer to the [Hardware Connection Guide](./1-hardware-guide/1-hardware-connection.md) for wiring diagrams.

### Fast Boot Sequence

1. **Power up**
   - Connect a USB power supply (or battery sled if you're running on batteries)
2. **Check the status LED**
   - The blue LED in the lower-left corner lights up when the system finishes booting (it may be hidden if the enclosure is installed)
   - OS init takes ~1 minute
3. **Enter configuration mode**
   - Hold the side button for ~2 seconds to wake the Wi-Fi AP; the CV light board turns blue (visible even with the cover on)
4. **Connect to the management UI**
   - Device hotspot SSID: `NE301_XXXXXX`
   - Join the Wi-Fi AP from your phone or laptop
   - Browse to http://192.168.10.10

> Tips: Joining the device AP will disconnect that phone/laptop from its previous network, so cloud access may pause while you configure the board.

### Board-Level Highlights

#### Camera Module Connection

Mind the J1/J2 markings on the ribbon cable. Hold both sides of the lens barrel (avoid fingerprints) and rotate to focus. You can verify focus live under **Function Debug** or **Hardware Management → Image Management** on the web UI.

</p>

#### CV Light Board

The plug-in light board exposes an AP indicator on the left (solid blue after boot) and a fill light on the right. Configure brightness, toggle, and time windows under **Hardware Management → Light Control**. Once saved, the fill light fires whenever a capture is triggered.

</p>

#### SD Card Slot

Supports hot swap. Navigate to **Storage Management** in the web UI to view the card status. If you insert a card after boot, refresh the page or switch tabs to force a status update. Supported file systems are listed in the hardware manual.

#### Power Options

Front USB for power/debug, back battery bay, or a plug-in PoE module.

#### LED States

</p>

- Red — Power LED, solid when USB power is present
- Blue — AP status LED, mirrors the CV board status once the system is ready
- Green — DEBUG LED, blinks while debugging is active

#### UART Debugging

</p>

The UART harness is keyed to avoid reversed insertion (see the hardware design guide). Use any serial console at 115200 bps to access the debug shell.

</div>

#### Web Configuration

Each device exposes a Wi-Fi AP named `NE301_${MAC last 6}`. You can also run `ifconfig ap info` over serial to confirm the SSID.

</p>

After joining the AP, browse to `192.168.10.10`. The default login is `admin` / `hicamthink`. Change the password under **System Settings → Device Password Management → Login Password**.

#### Power Modes

Developers typically keep the board on USB power. Once logged into the web UI, switch **Function Debug → Power Mode** to **Full Speed**.

Low-power mode targets battery use. After ~90 seconds of inactivity the device sleeps, turning off the blue indicators on both boards and leaving only the red power LED. Hold the side key for 2 seconds to wake it.

Set **System Settings → Device Password Management → Sleep Duration** to *Never* if you need the AP up continuously.

### Functional Validation Checklist

1. Enter sleep mode (confirm the device is in the low-power profile)
2. Trigger a capture task (scheduled, button, remote, or IO)
3. Review the image quality (resolution, exposure, focus)
4. Confirm upstream data delivery (server receives the image)

## FAQ

### Blurry Preview

Out-of-focus optics are the most common reason for blurry previews. Adjust the focus manually, trying both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations, until the live view is sharp.

Wiring reference:

</p>

### Unexpected Power Loss

When the board runs off the battery box, flipping DIP switch 1 to **NO** disconnects the pack and powers the system down. Return it to the original position to resume operation.
