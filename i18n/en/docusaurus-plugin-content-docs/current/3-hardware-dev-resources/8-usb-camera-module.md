## Product Introduction
This camera module is suitable for the NeoEyes 101 camera.
![image](https://resources.camthink.ai/wiki/img/hardware-dev-resources/usb-camera-module/usb6.png)
With the rapid development of AI vision applications, users’ demands for image quality, adaptability, and multi-scenario usage continue to grow.
The standard CPI module (OV5640) on the NeoEyes NE101 is stable for daily use but still shows limitations in **image detail, wide-angle imaging, and flexibility**.

To address these needs, we have specifically designed a USB expansion architecture, enabling NeoEyes NE101 to support multiple high-performance camera modules.
With low-level interface optimization, even when the **ESP-S3 platform originally does not support multiple cameras**, stable compatibility and quick expansion are achieved. This makes NeoEyes NE101 a visual platform with continuous upgradeability.

Comparison of main parameters:

| Comparison Item | Standard OV5640 | USB Module                    |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Lens Material   | Plastic Lens    | With Glass Lens               |
| Pixel Size      | 1.4×1.4μm       | 2.9×2.9μm (Higher Sensitivity)|
| ISP Type        | Integrated      | Independent ISP (Smarter)     |
| Focus Adjustment| Fixed           | Supports Adjustable Focus     |
| Image Quality   | Standard        | HD, More Detail               |
| Application Extensibility | Integrated | Customizable in Bulk      |
| Secondary Development | Not Supported | Supported                |
| HFOV           | Standard/Wide    | Standard/Wide/Super Wide      |

Note: OV5640 supports macro shooting. The USB module version currently does not support such specs. If you require macro focus (e.g., 8cm, 15cm), please choose the OV5640 version. For special needs, contact us for custom options.

Moreover, as an integrated component, OV5640’s design leaves little room for secondary development. It must connect to the main board, which processes raw data directly—resulting in a high technical threshold and requiring low-level drivers.

### USB Camera Module Selection Advice

- **For normal shooting/long-distance** → Choose *Standard Version*
- **For a wider field of view** → Choose *Wide Version*
- **For complex/large-scale monitoring at close range** → Choose *Super Wide Version*

## Three Core Strengths of the USB Module

### Superior Image Quality: Glass Lens + Independent ISP

- Uses a **glass lens** instead of plastic, providing higher transmittance and durability, effectively reducing chromatic aberration and distortion.
- Larger sensor pixels (2.9×2.9μm) deliver better image detail and low-light performance, with less noise.
- Independent ISP (Image Signal Processor) allows for more precise image tuning and wider dynamic range.

### Flexible Adaptation: Adjustable Focus + Standardized Interface

- Supports adjustable focus, so users can freely change focus for different scenarios (close-up recognition/remote monitoring).
- Standardized module interface and UVC protocol—developers can quickly switch modules without core driver changes. Truly plug-and-play.
- Customization services: hardware/firmware customization available.

### Open Ecosystem: Developer-Friendly for Secondary Development

- USB module is more suitable for developers, especially those requiring custom tuning or parameter adjustments, making secondary development easier.
- Longer-term maintainability and the ability to customize for different algorithms and application scenarios.
- More granular indoor/outdoor versions available, to suit smart access, automotive monitoring, industrial inspection, and more.

## Comprehensive Upgrade from Hardware to Experience

The USB module is not just a "better camera"—it represents an important step in NE101’s journey towards openness, expandability, and modular design.
From image quality to flexibility and future compatibility, we hope to empower developers with more choices and allow end products to perform better across all application scenarios.

---

## Who Should Consider the USB Module?

- Users demanding high image quality and clarity;
- AI vision applications where wide-angle or panoramic recognition is needed;
- Teams or enthusiasts seeking secondary development or flexible feature expansion.
