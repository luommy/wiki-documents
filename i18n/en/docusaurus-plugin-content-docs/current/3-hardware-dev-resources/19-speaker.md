## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Key Features

- **Square miniature design**: 30mm × 20mm compact size, suitable for space-constrained embedded devices
- **Adhesive mounting**: 1.2mm front and back adhesive, simplifying installation
- **High sensitivity**: 90dB SPL (0.5W/0.1m), sufficient volume at low power
- **Wide frequency response**: Fo(1000Hz) ~ 20KHz frequency range, covering the main human auditory range
- **RoHS compliant**: Meets environmental requirements

### 1.2 NE301 Application Scenarios

In the NE301 sensor expansion board, the speaker serves as a **local alarm and voice feedback output device**, capable of playing alarm sound effects when events are detected, or broadcasting alarm device status via voice. Combined with PIR/radar and other sensor triggers, it achieves a complete "detection—capture—alarm" closed loop.

| Application Scenario | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Security Alarm | Plays alarm sound effects after intrusion events are detected for on-site deterrence |
| Status Notification | Plays voice prompts when the device comes online/offline or encounters anomalies |
| IoT Gateway | Plays voice feedback after receiving remote commands to confirm operation execution |
| Industrial Equipment | Plays alarm prompts when sensor data exceeds thresholds |
