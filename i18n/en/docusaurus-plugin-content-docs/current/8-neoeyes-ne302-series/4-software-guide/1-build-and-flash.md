# Build, Flash and Update

This page covers source builds, hardware flashing and update package preparation for NE302. Use only the interface for the target MCU: STM32N6 uses `N6-STLINK`, while STM32U0 / WakeCore uses `U0-STLINK`.

Complete [Environment setup](./0-development-environment.md) first, then confirm the target device, source version and component to be flashed.

## 1. Identify the flashing target

| Target | MCU | Device interface | Boot switch | Main command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FSBL, App, Web, Model, WiFi | STM32N6 | `N6-STLINK` | `N6-BOOT` | `make flash-<component>` or `make flash` |
| WakeCore | STM32U0 | `U0-STLINK` | `U0-BOOT` | `make flash-wakecore` |

N6 and U0 are independent flashing paths. Connect only one path at a time. Do not use `N6-STLINK` for WakeCore or place a WakeCore file in the App, Model or Web update entry.

## 2. Build, sign and package

Run these commands from the source root:

```bash
make info
make                 # Build FSBL, App, Web, Model and WakeCore
make app             # Build App only
make web             # Build Web only
make model           # Build Model only
make wifi-image      # Build the WiFi image
```

The build and deployment steps differ by component:

| Component | Compile | Sign | Package | Flash |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| FSBL | `make fsbl` | `make sign-fsbl` | `make pkg-fsbl` for OTA | `make flash-fsbl` |
| App | `make app` | `make sign-app` | `make pkg-app` | `make flash-app` |
| Web | `make web` | Not required | `make pkg-web` | `make flash-web` |
| Model | `make model` | Not required | `make pkg-model` | `make flash-model` |
| WiFi | `make wifi-image` | Not required | `make pkg-wifi` | `make flash-wifi` |
| WakeCore | `make wakecore` | Not required | Not on the normal OTA path | `make flash-wakecore` |

The signed FSBL `.bin` can be flashed directly. App must be signed and then packaged. Web and Model do not require signing, but both flashing and OTA use packaged files. To create the complete OTA package set:

```bash
make sign
make pkg
```

WakeCore is flashed through its own build flow and is not included in the normal `make pkg` set.

### Model runtime variant

The source supports `2.2`, `3.0` and `4.0`, with `4.0` as the default. When rebuilding a model, `STEDGEAI_VARIANT`, `STEDGEAI_CORE_DIR`, the App runtime and the Model package must use the same variant:

```bash
make model STEDGEAI_VARIANT=4.0
```

If the variants differ, return to [Environment setup](./0-development-environment.md), correct the tools and rebuild before flashing.

## 3. Flash STM32N6

STM32N6 covers FSBL, App, Web, Model and WiFi. The sequence is fixed: **set the switch → connect the hardware → power or reset → run the command on the PC → return the switch to run mode**.

The image below labels the programming and serial interfaces on the actual Interface Board: `N6-STLINK` is for STM32N6, `U0-STLINK` is for STM32U0, and the middle `U6-UART` connector is serial, not an ST-LINK flashing interface.

### Hardware connection

1. Power off the device.
2. Set the interface-board `N6-BOOT` switch toward the printed **ON** side.
3. Connect: **device `N6-STLINK` → ST-LINK → PC**.
4. Power on or reset the device.

### Run the flashing command

From the source directory on the PC, run the required command:

```bash
make flash-fsbl
make flash-app
make flash-web
make flash-model
make flash-wifi
```

To flash all N6 components at once:

```bash
make flash
```

`make flash` flashes FSBL, App, Web, Model and WiFi, then runs `erase-ota`. It changes device state; prefer a single-component command for routine development.

### Return to run mode

1. Power off the device.
2. Return `N6-BOOT` to **OFF**.
3. Power on or reset and wait for the device to start.

## 4. Flash STM32U0 / WakeCore

STM32U0 runs WakeCore. It has a separate interface and Boot switch and must not use the N6 connection path.

### Hardware connection and flashing

1. Power off the device.
2. Set the interface-board `U0-BOOT` switch toward the printed **ON** side.
3. Connect: **device `U0-STLINK` → ST-LINK → PC**.
4. Power on or reset the device.
5. From the source directory on the PC, run:

   ```bash
   make flash-wakecore
   ```

### Return to run mode

1. Power off the device.
2. Return `U0-BOOT` to **OFF**.
3. Power on or reset and check WakeCore wake-up and trigger behavior.

## 5. Update packages and HEX outputs

The device Web console **Firmware Upgrade** page uses packaged files. See [System Maintenance](../2-user-guide/3-system-maintenance.md#2-firmware-upgrade) for the mapping between files and update entries. Upload only a package matching the component and version. Model and App must also use the same `STEDGEAI_VARIANT`.

To generate combined flashing outputs:

```bash
make pack-hex
make pack-hex-wakecore
```

The main firmware, main firmware plus WiFi and WakeCore HEX outputs target different MCUs and must not be interchanged.

## 6. Confirm after flashing

1. Confirm that the target Boot switch is **OFF**, then power-cycle the device.
2. Open the Web console and check the component version under **Firmware Information**.
3. After updating App, Web or Model, check preview and inference in **Feature Debugging**.
4. After updating WakeCore, check that the device wakes and responds to triggers as expected.

If the PC cannot detect the target, first check device power, the Boot switch position, the selected `N6-STLINK` or `U0-STLINK` interface, and whether the other flashing path is still connected.

## 7. Erase commands

The following commands change device state. Confirm the target device and back up required configuration first:

```bash
make erase-nvs
make erase-ota
make erase-all
make erase-chip
```

`erase-chip` erases the entire chip and is not a routine build or flashing step.
