# Product Information

## Product Overview

NeoEyes NE302 is a Mini AI Vision Camera for device integration. It combines 4 MP image capture, STM32N6 edge AI, wireless connectivity and local storage on a 38 × 38 mm Main Board. A complete NE302 shipment includes the Main Board and Interface Board: the two-board device supports continuous USB Type-C power or a USB Type-C external battery pack; the Main Board can also be used for custom integration with DC power.

### Core Capabilities

- **Edge AI inference**: STM32N6 Cortex-M55 and Neural-ART perform INT8 inference on the device.
- **Image capture and encoding**: The product supports 4 MP image capture; H.264 video encoding supports up to 1920 × 1080 at 30 fps, with hardware JPEG encoding.
- **Two-board expansion and custom integration**: The Interface Board provides the complete device with USB Type-C power, MicroSD, control and development connections for installation, maintenance and further development; the Main Board can also be used for custom integration with DC power.
- **Wireless connectivity**: 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth Low Energy are supported; radio revision, antenna and regional configuration follow the delivered SKU.
- **Local storage and data delivery**: MicroSD storage and the Web console support preview, capture, model validation and device management.
- **Lighting and extensions**: Some hardware revisions may expose supplemental lighting or extension modules. Confirm availability against the delivered SKU and firmware.
- **Development resources**: The open engineering project contains FSBL, application, Web, model and WakeCore components for build, packaging, flashing and OTA development.
- **Compact installation**: The enclosure baseline is 42 × 42 × 20 mm and supports indoor magnetic or 3M-adhesive mounting according to the product design.

## Performance and Edge AI

### Vision-AI Computing

NE302 uses the STM32N6 Cortex-M55 and Neural-ART accelerator for image processing and local AI inference. The engineering project contains object-detection, pose-estimation and model-switching support; usable models, input sizes and performance depend on the model package, firmware and hardware revision.

| Capability | NE302 boundary |
| :--- | :--- |
| Inference location | Local device inference |
| Acceleration | Neural-ART, up to 0.6 TOPS INT8 in product material |
| Model source | Model files, JSON configuration and packaging flow under `Model/` |
| Runtime validation | Model Validation in the Web console |
| Performance claims | A single-device test or one displayed model is not a system-wide performance commitment |

### Image and Data Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S[Image sensor] --> I[ISP and capture]
  I --> E[H.264 or JPEG]
  I --> N[Local INT8 inference]
  E --> P[Preview or storage]
  N --> R[Structured result]
  P --> W[Web console or application]
  R --> W
```

The Web console can show a preview, execute a capture, validate a model and inspect stored records. Result delivery and media-stream configuration depend on the MQTT, Webhook, RTSP or RTMP pages exposed by the current firmware. Protocol choices, fields and compatibility must follow the delivered release.

## Hardware Introduction

### Main Board

The Main Board integrates the STM32N6, STM32U0, camera, PSRAM, SPI Flash, and wireless-related circuits. See [Components Overview](./3-hardware-guide/0-components-overview.md) to identify the board, camera, antenna, and hardware-version boundaries.

### Interface Board

The Interface Board exposes the connections needed for use and development, including USB Type-C, MicroSD, debug/flash channels, serial access and other revision-dependent interfaces. It is the main reference for first assembly, flashing and field connection.

### Version Notes

Delivered versions may differ in radio revision, lens, antenna, debug interfaces and power input. Do not infer a specific SKU from a product render or generic annotated board image. Check the delivered hardware record before installation, flashing or model deployment.

The current public wireless baseline is Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth Low Energy. A Wi-Fi HaLow-compatible version is planned, but it requires the corresponding wireless hardware and is not part of the current delivery baseline. Confirm the delivered version and hardware configuration when Wi-Fi HaLow is required.

## Product Applications

NE302 is positioned around compact camera integration, local AI and device-level result delivery. The following are product-positioning examples, not verified customer cases or fixed SKUs. Validate the lens, lighting, model, trigger path and result protocol before deployment.
