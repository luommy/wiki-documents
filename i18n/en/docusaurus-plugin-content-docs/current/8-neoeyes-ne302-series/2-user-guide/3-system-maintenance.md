# System Maintenance

Use this page to change the login password, upgrade firmware and manage device storage. Network connection and result delivery are covered in [Data Transmission](./1-data-transmission.md); capture storage policy and Records are covered in [Capture and Storage](./0-capture-storage.md).

## 1. Change login password

Open **System Settings → Device Password**:

1. Enter and confirm the new password in **Login Password**. Its length is 8–32 characters.
2. Click **save** in that section.
3. Sign out, then sign in with the new password.

**Username** is `admin`. **Local WiFi Settings** is a separate configuration group; saving Wi-Fi settings may require reconnecting to the device network.

## 2. Firmware Upgrade

Open **System Settings → Firmware Upgrade**. Check the installed versions under **Firmware Information**, then download firmware from [NE302 GitHub Releases](https://github.com/camthink-ai/ne302/releases). The table uses `v4.3.0`; for another version, use only the matching files from its Release.

| Component | v4.3.0 file | Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **App** | [ne302_App_signed_v4.3.0.12_pkg.bin](https://github.com/camthink-ai/ne302/releases/download/v4.3.0/ne302_App_signed_v4.3.0.12_pkg.bin) | App upload entry |
| **Web** | [ne302_Web_v1.5.0.1_pkg.bin](https://github.com/camthink-ai/ne302/releases/download/v4.3.0/ne302_Web_v1.5.0.1_pkg.bin) | Web upload entry |
| **AI Model** | [ne302_Model_v4.0.0.0_pkg.bin](https://github.com/camthink-ai/ne302/releases/download/v4.3.0/ne302_Model_v4.0.0.0_pkg.bin) | AI Model upload entry |
| **FSBL** | [ne302_FSBL_signed_v1.0.3.0_pkg.bin](https://github.com/camthink-ai/ne302/releases/download/v4.3.0/ne302_FSBL_signed_v1.0.3.0_pkg.bin) | **FSBL Firmware Upgrade** under **Advanced Options** |
| **WiFi Firmware** | [ne302_Wifi_flash_v2.15.5.2_pkg.bin](https://github.com/camthink-ai/ne302/releases/download/v4.3.0/ne302_Wifi_flash_v2.15.5.2_pkg.bin) | **WiFi Firmware Upgrade** under **Advanced Options** |
| **WakeCore** | [ne302_WakeCore.bin](https://github.com/camthink-ai/ne302/releases/download/v4.3.0/ne302_WakeCore.bin) | Not a Web upload; flash through U0-STLINK as described in [Build and Flash](../4-software-guide/1-build-and-flash.md) |

Use **Export Firmware** first if the current configuration must be retained. Its **Device File** is a `.json` configuration backup, not an upgrade package.

1. Download the `_pkg.bin` for one component; upgrade one component at a time.
2. Upload it to the matching entry under **Import Firmware**. For App, Web, AI Model and FSBL, click **Confirm Burn** after validation completes.
3. For WiFi, upload `ne302_Wifi_flash_*_pkg.bin`, wait for the page to report that it was written to Flash, then click **Confirm Upgrade**.
4. Wait for the device to restart, sign in again and confirm the version in **Firmware Information**.

Upgrade FSBL only when a Release or engineer explicitly requires it. Do not mix packages from different Releases or upload `.json`, `.hex` or unpackaged images to an OTA entry.

## 3. Storage Management

Open **Storage Management** and check **SD Card Status** and available **Internal Flash** space.

![NE302 Storage Management](https://resources.camthink.ai/wiki/img/neoeyes-ne302-series/user-guide/system-maintenance/ne302-storage-management.png)

In the relevant **File Manager**, use **Preview** to identify a file and **Download** to keep it before deleting the selected file or directory. Deleting a directory also deletes its contents.

To clear internal Flash, export any required files first. Then open **File Manager → Format Flash**, enter the device password and confirm. Formatting permanently removes files on internal Flash.
