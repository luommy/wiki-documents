# System Flashing

NE503 initial system flashing, boot-chain recovery, MCU firmware programming, and deployment verification.

## 1. Prepare Firmware and Host

### 1.1 Download the Firmware

Download the `hailo15-ne503` firmware, BSP, and flashing-tool wheel from [meta-hailo-os Releases](https://github.com/camthink-ai/meta-hailo-os/releases), then extract them on an Ubuntu host. The wheel is also available in the repository's [`tools/` directory](https://github.com/camthink-ai/meta-hailo-os/tree/main/tools). All files must come from the same Release.

See the [NE503 firmware and deployment guide](https://github.com/camthink-ai/meta-hailo-os/blob/main/docs/hailo15-ne503-firmware-and-deployment.md) for the complete file list.

Boot-chain files (used in Section 2):

```text
hailo15_uart_recovery_fw.bin
hailo15_scu_bl.bin
scu_bl_cfg_a.bin
hailo15_scu_fw.bin
u-boot.dtb.signed
u-boot-spl.bin
u-boot-initial-env
customer_certificate.bin
u-boot-tfa.itb
```

System-image files (used in Section 3):

```text
fitImage
swupdate-image-hailo15-ne503.ext4.gz
hailo-update-image-hailo15-ne503.swu
```

### 1.2 Install Tools and Connect the Device

Host: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04. Prepare a 1.8V-compatible USB-to-serial cable, an Ethernet cable, and PoE.

```bash
pip install tools/hailo15_board_tools-<VERSION>-py3-none-any.whl
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install u-boot-tools
```

Connect the debug serial cable and confirm the device node:

```bash
ls -lh /dev/serial/by-id/
screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

The commands use `/dev/ttyACM0`; replace it with the actual node.

### 1.3 Configure TFTP

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tftpd-hpa
sudo nano /etc/default/tftpd-hpa
```

Confirm:

```text
TFTP_USERNAME="tftp"
TFTP_DIRECTORY="/var/lib/tftpboot"
TFTP_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:69"
TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure"
```

Copy the system images and restart TFTP:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/tftpboot
sudo chown tftp:tftp /var/lib/tftpboot
sudo chmod 755 /var/lib/tftpboot
sudo cp fitImage /var/lib/tftpboot/
sudo cp swupdate-image-hailo15-ne503.ext4.gz /var/lib/tftpboot/
sudo cp hailo-update-image-hailo15-ne503.swu /var/lib/tftpboot/
sudo systemctl restart tftpd-hpa
```

## 2. Recover the Boot Chain

Use this section for a new device or when the U-Boot menu is unavailable. If it is available, skip to [Section 3](#3-flash-the-system-to-emmc).

### 2.1 Enter UART Recovery Mode

Set BOOT0 to **OFF** and BOOT1 to **ON**, power the device through PoE, and press Reset.

![DIP switch flash mode](https://resources.camthink.ai/wiki/img/neoeyes-ne503-series/software-guide/system-flashing/sys-07-dip-switch.png)

### 2.2 Load the UART Recovery Firmware

```bash
uart_boot_fw_loader \
  --serial-device-name /dev/ttyACM0 \
  --firmware ./hailo15_uart_recovery_fw.bin
```

### 2.3 Write the SPI Flash Boot Components

```bash
hailo15_spi_flash_program \
  --scu-bootloader ./hailo15_scu_bl.bin \
  --scu-bootloader-config ./scu_bl_cfg_a.bin \
  --scu-firmware ./hailo15_scu_fw.bin \
  --uboot-device-tree ./u-boot.dtb.signed \
  --bootloader ./u-boot-spl.bin \
  --bootloader-env ./u-boot-initial-env \
  --customer-certificate ./customer_certificate.bin \
  --uboot-tfa ./u-boot-tfa.itb \
  --uart-load \
  --serial-device-name /dev/ttyACM0
```

Expected output (excerpt; repeated erase and validation lines are omitted):

```text

Provided file ./u-boot-tfa.itb was successfully programmed
```

**Success:** all 8 components show `successfully programmed` and the command exits with code `0`.

After flashing, power off the device, return BOOT0 and BOOT1 to **OFF**, and power it on again.

## 3. Flash the System to eMMC

### 3.1 Enter the U-Boot Menu

1. Connect PoE through RJ45 and power on the device;
2. Set the serial terminal to `115200`;
3. During the boot countdown, press `↑` or `↓` to open the U-Boot menu.

![U-Boot boot menu](https://resources.camthink.ai/wiki/img/neoeyes-ne503-series/software-guide/system-flashing/sys-21-emmc-init-1.png)

### 3.2 Configure the Network

Connect the Ubuntu TFTP host and the device to the same subnet. The default device IP is `10.0.0.1` and the host IP is `10.0.0.2`; for another subnet, select **U-Boot console**:

```text
setenv ipaddr 192.168.93.XXX
setenv serverip 192.168.93.YYY
saveenv
reset
```

Set `serverip` to the IP address of the host running TFTP.

### 3.3 Write the System Image

After confirming the network settings, select **eMMC AB Board Init** in the U-Boot menu. If you just ran `reset`, re-enter the menu as described in Section 3.1. Do not remove power or Ethernet during the write; the device reboots when complete.

## 4. Log In and Verify

After reboot, log in through the serial console or SSH:

```text
Username: root
Password: root
```

Change the default password and verify:

```bash
passwd
cat /data/aipc/VERSION
df -h /
lsmod | grep hailo
ip addr show eth0
```

**Success:** the password is changed, `VERSION` returns the full version information, the device has an IP address, the root filesystem is mounted, and Hailo kernel modules are loaded.

After a first-time deployment, choose the MCU programming method in Section 5 based on the device state.

## 5. Flash the MCU Firmware

Choose based on the device state:

- MCU is not programmed, the device cannot run normally, or OTA is unavailable: flash the HEX with ST-LINK;
- The system boots normally: update the MCU with OTA and the `.bin` package.

### 5.1 Flash the HEX File with ST-LINK

Prepare ST-LINK, [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html), and device power. Connect ST-LINK to the interface board's ST-LINK/SWD port: connect `PA13` to `SWDIO` and `PA14` to `SWDCLK/BOOT0`. Keep the device in normal boot mode.

![ST-LINK location on the interface board](https://resources.camthink.ai/wiki/img/neoeyes-ne503-series/software-guide/system-flashing/mcu-st-link-port.png)

Download and use the [combined HEX file `ne503_Main_v0.1.7_20260723.hex`](https://resources.camthink.ai/tools/ne503_Main_v0.1.7_20260723.hex):

```text
ne503_Main_v0.1.7_20260723.hex
```

Confirm that the host detects ST-LINK and STM32G0B0:

```bash
STM32_Programmer_CLI -l
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD
```

Flash and verify:

```bash
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=swd -e all -w ./ne503_Main_v0.1.7_20260723.hex -v -rst
```

`-e all` erases the entire MCU. Confirm the target device and firmware file before running it.

**Success:** download and verification complete with exit code `0`. Disconnect ST-LINK and reboot the device.

### 5.2 Update a Running Device over OTA

Use OTA only when the system boots normally. Use the `ne503_ota_package_v<X.Y.Z>.bin` package matching the NeoRuntime Release; do not upload a `.hex` file to the OTA directory.

1. Download the [OTA package `ne503_ota_package_v0.1.7.bin`](https://resources.camthink.ai/tools/ne503_ota_package_v0.1.7.bin) to the Ubuntu host;
2. Set the device address and upload the package:

```bash
DEVICE_IP="<device-ip>"
OTA_PACKAGE="ne503_ota_package_v0.1.7.bin"

ssh root@"$DEVICE_IP" "mkdir -p /data/aipc/firmware/mcu"
scp "$OTA_PACKAGE" root@"$DEVICE_IP":/data/aipc/firmware/mcu/
ssh root@"$DEVICE_IP" "test -s /data/aipc/firmware/mcu/$OTA_PACKAGE && ls -lh /data/aipc/firmware/mcu/$OTA_PACKAGE"
```

After the remote file information is displayed, keep power connected and reboot:

```bash
ssh root@"$DEVICE_IP" reboot
```

The SSH connection will close normally. After the device is back online, verify:

```bash
ssh root@"$DEVICE_IP" 'journalctl -b -u aipc-mcu-prep.service --no-pager | grep -F "rtc=ok ota=done rc=0"'
```

**Success:** the log contains `rtc=ok ota=done rc=0`.
