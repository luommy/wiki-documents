# AI-Assisted Development

This example uses **Claude Code** and ne503-dev to build a “10-second loitering alert” app: alert after a person remains for 10 seconds, then reset after the person leaves.

:::tip Try the packaged app
Download the [prebuilt package](https://resources.camthink.ai/wiki/img/neoeyes-ne503-series/application-guide/app-development/ai-assisted-dev/lingering-detection.tar), extract it, and follow the [Hello World deployment steps](./1-hello-world.md#3-deploy-to-the-device).
:::

## 1. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Need |
|:--|:--|
| Claude Code | Installed and working |
| ne503-dev | [Download](https://resources.camthink.ai/wiki/img/neoeyes-ne503-series/application-guide/app-development/ai-assisted-dev/ne503-dev.zip) and extract to ~/.claude/skills/ne503-dev/ |
| Docker | Build ARM64 images |
| NE503 | Connected; model, HAL v2, and ai-runtime available |

## 2. Development Flow

Call ne503-dev in Claude Code with:

> Send an alert when a person remains for 10 seconds. Deploy to the device IP.

Confirm the duration, detection threshold, and device address. The tool then:

1. Queries the device's available model and raw stream;
2. Generates the state machine, app.yaml, and permissions;
3. Builds the ARM64 image, installs, and starts the app.

The example uses hailo_yolov8n_384_640 and raw stream sub. Use values returned by the device instead of copying names from another device.

## 3. Verify

Confirm:

- app state is Running;
- logs show model loading and the first inference;
- a person entering the frame triggers an alert and leaving resets the state.
