# Parking Lot

This recipe deploys the Parking Lot Showcase from `neoruntime-apps` on NE503 and verifies vehicle events through the Event Bus.

The full source and configuration are in [neoruntime-apps/showcases/parking-lot](https://github.com/camthink-ai/neoruntime-apps/tree/main/showcases/parking-lot). This page keeps only the information needed to deploy and verify the app; use the repository for implementation details.

## 1. Goal and prerequisites

After completing this recipe, you should see the Parking Lot Monitor page and be able to receive:

- `parking/vehicles`: vehicle boxes and confidence values;
- `parking/plates`: plate regions and recognized text;
- `parking/alerts`: depth anti-spoof alerts.

Before you start, confirm that:

- NE503 has a working OS installation and the Web Console is reachable;
- the four HEFs required by the Showcase are available under `/data/aipc/models`;
- you will use the ARM64 Release bundle, or have Docker and the source build environment ready.

## 2. App structure

### 2.1 Models and events

| Model ID | Purpose | Input |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `yolov5m_vehicles` | Vehicle detection | RGB, 1920 × 1080 |
| `scdepthv3` | Depth anti-spoof analysis | RGB, 320 × 256 |
| `license_plate_det` | Plate-region detection | RGB, 416 × 416 |
| `plate_recognition` | Plate-character recognition | NV12, 320 × 48 |

The app reads the model files from the device's read-only `/data/aipc/models` mount. At startup it registers models from `MODEL_DEFS`; the repository contains the full paths, post-processing configuration, and pipeline code.

### 2.2 Data flow

```text

Parking Lot Web UI                         Event Bus
                                             ├─ parking/vehicles
                                             ├─ parking/plates
                                             └─ parking/alerts
```

The default manifest uses `sub.raw` and `STREAM_ID=sub`. The app probes available streams against the model input sizes; do not change the stream name independently in `app.py` and `app.yaml`, or inference will fail when the device has no matching raw stream.

## 3. Get and configure the app

### 3.1 Download the Release bundle

The recommended path is the [Parking Lot ARM64 bundle](https://github.com/camthink-ai/neoruntime-apps/releases/download/showcase-bundles-latest/parking-lot-latest-arm64.tar.gz). After extraction, it should contain `app.yaml`, `parking-lot-image.tar`, and `SHA256SUMS`:

```bash
tar -xzf parking-lot-latest-arm64.tar.gz
cd parking-lot-*-arm64
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

### 3.2 Build from source

You need Docker, `neoruntime-apps`, and the sibling `neoruntime-sdks` repository:

```bash
cd ../neoruntime-sdks/python
python -m pip install --upgrade build
python -m build --wheel

cd ../../neoruntime-apps
scripts/build_showcase_artifacts.sh \
  --wheel ../neoruntime-sdks/python/dist/hailo_ipc_sdk-*.whl \
  parking-lot --arch arm64 --output dist/showcases
```

The output is written to `dist/showcases/`. Follow the [neoruntime-apps README](https://github.com/camthink-ai/neoruntime-apps#showcase-bundles) for the current build requirements.

### 3.3 Check the key manifest fields

Before installation, open `app.yaml` and confirm that an old bundle has not restored the wrong values:

```yaml
permissions:
  video:
    - sub.raw
  inference:
    models:
      - yolov5m_vehicles
      - scdepthv3
      - license_plate_det
      - plate_recognition
    allow_register_model: true
  events:
    publish:
      - parking/vehicles
      - parking/plates
      - parking/alerts
  network:
    mode: host

env:
  - name: STREAM_ID
    value: "sub"
  - name: HD_PREVIEW_ENABLED
    value: "0"
```

With `HD_PREVIEW_ENABLED=0`, the page uses the app's own MJPEG `/stream` preview. On current shipping firmware, the platform H.264 address may listen only on an internal loopback address; an old manifest with `1` can therefore show a black preview in an external browser.

## 4. Install, start, and open the page

### 4.1 Install

In the Web Console, open **App Management**, import the extracted `app.yaml` and `parking-lot-image.tar`, then click **Install**.

You can also use the installation command from the repository README on an authenticated device terminal:

```bash
aipc-cli app install app.yaml parking-lot-image.tar
```

### 4.2 Start

After installation, open **App Management → Installed Apps**, find `parking_lot`, and click **Start**. Wait for **Running** before verifying; an installed container is not proof that the inference pipeline is working.

### 4.3 Open the Web UI

Open this URL from a browser that can reach the device:

```text
http://<deviceIP>:8090
```

On success you should see `Parking Lot Monitor`, a live preview, and model statistics. If the page loads but the preview is black, first confirm `HD_PREVIEW_ENABLED` is `0`, then check that `http://<deviceIP>:8090/stream` returns an MJPEG stream.

## 5. Verify the result

### 5.1 Verify the page and vehicle detection

1. Refresh `http://<deviceIP>:8090` and wait for the page to finish loading.
2. Confirm that the preview shows the real camera feed.
3. Confirm that `Active Models` lists all four models.
4. Point the camera at vehicles and watch the vehicle boxes, the `VEHICLES` count, and the statistics.

`FPS`, inference latency, and detection counts vary with the scene, firmware, and device load; they are not fixed performance guarantees.

### 5.2 Verify the Event Bus

Subscribe to the parking topics on the device:

```bash
aipc-cli event subscribe 'parking/*'
```

Point the camera at vehicles and first confirm `parking/vehicles`; its payload should include vehicle boxes and confidence values. `parking/plates` appears only when the frame contains a clear plate that meets the model conditions, and `parking/alerts` appears only when depth analysis triggers an anti-spoof condition. No message on those two topics does not by itself mean that the models failed to start.

### 5.3 Check status and logs

In the app details page, confirm **Running** and inspect the app logs. Check for:

- successful registration of all four models;
- recurring media capture failures, model timeouts, or `Pipeline error` messages;
- unexpected app restarts;
- a scene that actually meets the plate or anti-spoof trigger condition when the page has video but no corresponding event.
