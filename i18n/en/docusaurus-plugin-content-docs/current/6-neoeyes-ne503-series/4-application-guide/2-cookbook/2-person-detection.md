# Person Detection

This recipe uses `neoruntime-apps/examples/person-detection` to run a minimal containerized person-detection app: subscribe to a raw video stream, use the device's `person-detection` model, publish detection events, and trigger the white light when the device supports it.

The complete code, manifest, and Dockerfile are in the [Person Detection example](https://github.com/camthink-ai/neoruntime-apps/tree/main/examples/person-detection). This page keeps only the steps needed to run the example.

## 1. Goal and prerequisites

After completing this recipe, you should see person-detection results and receive the `app/person-detection/detection` event.

Before you start, confirm that:

- the NE503 Web Console is reachable;
- the `person-detection` model is available on the device;
- Docker, Git, and network access to `neoruntime-apps` and `neoruntime-sdks` are ready.

## 2. Key configuration

The values below come from the repository's `app.yaml` and `app.py`:

| Item | Current value | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| SDK module | `hailo_ipc_sdk` | Python SDK imported in the container |
| Video permission | `third.raw` | Permission for the raw video stream |
| Subscribed stream | `third` | Stream passed to `InferenceClient.subscribe()` |
| Model ID | `person-detection` | Model that must be available on the device |
| Detection threshold | `0.7` | Person confidence threshold injected by the manifest |
| Alert topic | `alerts/detection` | Published at the `ALERT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` interval |

If the model or stream names differ, update `app.yaml` and `app.py` together after checking the device values.

## 3. Get and build the app

### 3.1 Get the source and check the manifest

Clone the app and SDK repositories:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camthink-ai/neoruntime-sdks.git
git clone https://github.com/camthink-ai/neoruntime-apps.git
cd neoruntime-apps/examples/person-detection
```

The manifest must include these permissions and settings:

```yaml
permissions:
  video:
    - third.raw
  inference:
    models:
      - person-detection
    max_qps: 30
    max_concurrent: 2
    allow_register_model: false
  events:
    publish:
      - app/person-detection/*
      - alerts/detection
  device:
    light: true
    ir_cut: true

env:
  - name: DETECTION_THRESHOLD
    value: "0.7"
  - name: ALERT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS
    value: "5"
  - name: LOG_LEVEL
    value: "INFO"
```

See the complete [`app.yaml`](https://github.com/camthink-ai/neoruntime-apps/blob/main/examples/person-detection/app.yaml). `allow_register_model: false` means the device must already provide `person-detection`.

### 3.2 Build the ARM64 package

The device runs ARM64 images. From the `neoruntime-apps` root, use the unified build script:

```bash
cd ../..
./scripts/build_app.sh examples/person-detection --arch arm64
```

The script gets `hailo_ipc_sdk` from the sibling `neoruntime-sdks/python` and creates:

```text
examples/person-detection/person-detection.aipc
```

See the [Python SDK instructions in neoruntime-sdks](https://github.com/camthink-ai/neoruntime-sdks#python-sdk) for the wheel path.

## 4. Install and start

### 4.1 Install

In the Web Console, open **App Management**, import `person-detection.aipc`, and click **Install**.

From a device terminal, extract the package and install the separate manifest and image tar:

```bash
unzip -o examples/person-detection/person-detection.aipc \
  -d /tmp/person-detection
cd /tmp/person-detection
aipc-cli app install app.yaml image.tar
```

### 4.2 Start

In **App Management**, find `person-detection`, click **Start**, and wait for **Running**.

## 5. Verify the result

### 5.1 Verify app state and permissions

In the app details page, confirm:

- the state is **Running**;
- video permission includes `third.raw`;
- model permission includes `person-detection`;
- event publish permissions include `app/person-detection/*` and `alerts/detection`.

### 5.2 Check the logs

Open **Logs** in the app details page, or fetch the app logs through the device API. You should see records equivalent to:

```text
Available models: [..., 'person-detection', ...]
Available video streams: [..., 'third', ...]
Subscribing to stream 'third' with model 'person-detection'
[OK] Received first inference result
Detected 1 person(s)
Statistics: frames=..., detections=..., avg_persons=...
```

If no first result appears, check that `third.raw` and `person-detection` are available.

### 5.3 Verify events

Subscribe to the app events on the device:

```bash
aipc-cli event subscribe 'app/person-detection/*'
```

When `app/person-detection/detection` arrives, check:

- `person_count`: people in the current frame;
- `objects[].confidence`: person confidence;
- `objects[].bbox`: normalized detection box;
- `frame_sequence` and `timestamp_ns`: frame and timing information.

The app publishes `alerts/detection` according to `ALERT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`. Fill-light control requires the corresponding hardware and permission.
