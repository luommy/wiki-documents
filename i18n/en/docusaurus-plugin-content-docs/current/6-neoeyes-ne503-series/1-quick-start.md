## Overview

### Kit Contents

| Component | Qty | Description |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| NE503 main unit | 1 | Core processing board and interface board, IP67 rated |
| Wall-mount screw pack | 1 | Mounting screws and hardware |

### Prerequisites

The following items must be provided by the user:

- **PoE switch** (802.3AT, recommended) + Ethernet cable: a single cable provides both power and network connectivity
- **Or** DC 12V power adapter + standard switch + Ethernet cable: for environments without a PoE switch
- **Computer**: equipped with an Ethernet port, running Windows / macOS / Linux, with a modern browser (Chrome / Edge / Firefox / Safari)

---

## Device Installation and Power-On

### 1. Choose Installation Location

The NE503 serves as both a smart IPC and an edge computing platform. Consider both surveillance coverage and AI inference performance when choosing the installation spot:

- **Surveillance coverage**: Select a position that covers the target area. Note the lens field of view (wide-angle: 45.1° horizontal, telephoto: 14.7°)
- **Environmental requirements**: IP67 rated, supports -40°C to +60°C operating temperature, suitable for outdoor installation
- **Cable planning**: Ensure the Ethernet cable from the PoE switch or router reaches the installation location

### 2. Wall-Mount Installation

1. Secure the wall-mount bracket to the mounting surface (wall / pole / ceiling) using the included screw pack
2. Align the NE503 with the bracket and tighten the mounting screws

> Pole and ceiling mounting scenarios require additional bracket accessories, sold separately.

### 3. Power Supply and Boot

The NE503 supports two power supply methods, with power consumption 5–6W (typical load):

| Method | Connection | Use Case |
|--------|------------|----------|
| PoE (recommended) | Connect Ethernet cable to a PoE switch (802.3AT) — single cable for power and network | Most deployment scenarios |
| DC adapter | Connect 12V adapter to DC port, Ethernet cable to standard switch | Environments without a PoE switch |

After powering on, the device indicator blinks during startup. Once it stays solid, the device is ready (approximately 30-60 seconds).

## First-Time Connection and Initial Configuration

The NE503 ships with a default IP of `10.0.0.1`. This section guides you through the first login, password change, network configuration, and time zone setup.

### 1. Configure Computer IP

For first-time access, set your computer's Ethernet IP to the `10.0.0.x` subnet (e.g., `10.0.0.100`, subnet mask `255.255.255.0`), then run `ping 10.0.0.1` to confirm connectivity.

### 2. Log In to the Web Console

Open a browser and navigate to `http://10.0.0.1:8080`:

![](https://resources.camthink.ai/wiki/img/neoeyes-ne503-series/quick-start/qs-login.png)

Log in with the default credentials: username `admin`, password `password`.

After logging in, you will see the Dashboard. The page is organized into the following sections from top to bottom:

- **Device Status**: Device uptime, chip temperatures (SoC / MCU / CPU / Board), light brightness, IR LED toggle, IR-CUT filter mode
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time gauges for CPU / NPU / Memory / Storage usage
- **Stream Preview**: Live camera preview
- **Applications**: Installed app list with running status and resource usage
- **AI Models**: Overview of loaded models
- **Monitor**: System resource trend charts
- **Device Info**: Device name, IP address, MAC address, firmware version, build date

![](https://resources.camthink.ai/wiki/img/neoeyes-ne503-series/quick-start/qs-dashboard.png)

> Click the expand icon in the top-left corner to show the navigation bar labels for easier page navigation.

### 4. Configure Network

The factory IP `10.0.0.1` is for initial configuration only. After connecting the device to your actual LAN, switch to DHCP or assign a static IP so other devices can reach it.

Go to **Settings → Network**:

![](https://resources.camthink.ai/wiki/img/neoeyes-ne503-series/quick-start/qs-settings-network.png)

| Mode | Use Case | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| DHCP | Automatic IP from router | Enable directly; consider binding the MAC address in the router to prevent IP changes |
| Static IP | Production environments requiring a fixed IP | Manually enter IP, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS |

### 5. Set Time Zone

Go to **Settings → Time Settings** and select the correct time zone and configure an NTP server. Time zone settings directly affect video stream OSD timestamps and recording file names — ensure they match your deployment location.

### 2. RTSP Stream Verification

RTSP is the primary video protocol for integrating NE503 with external systems. The device provides three streams:

| Stream | Address | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Main stream | `rtsp://<device-ip>:8554/main` | 4K high-definition recording (3840×2160) |
| Sub stream | `rtsp://<device-ip>:8554/sub` | Low-bandwidth preview |
| Third stream | `rtsp://<device-ip>:8554/third` | AI analysis / mobile |

**Verifying with VLC:**

1. Open VLC → Media → Open Network Stream, enter the RTSP address

</div>

### 3. Verification and Operation

After installation, the application appears in the App Management list. Click the application card to view its running status, resource usage, and perform start / stop / restart / uninstall operations.

NX Witness verification:

| Service | Address |
|---------|---------|
| NX Witness management interface | `https://<device-ip>:7001` |
| RTSP stream | `rtsp://<device-ip>:554/` (specific stream path depends on NX Witness configuration) |

> Port 554 in the table above is NX Witness's own RTSP service port, which is different from NE503's port 8554. When adding the NE503 camera stream in NX Witness, use the NE503 RTSP address `rtsp://<device-ip>:8554/main`.

Open `https://<device-ip>:7001` in a browser. On first access, the NX Witness setup wizard appears. Select **Setup New Site**, follow the wizard to create an admin account, and add the NE503 RTSP stream (`rtsp://<device-ip>:8554/main`) to get started.

**NX Witness Troubleshooting**:

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Container STOPPED with `no new privileges` in logs | Security policy blocking privilege escalation | Confirm container security settings allow privilege escalation |
| Web interface inaccessible | Network mode is not Host | Disable Isolated Mode during installation |
| Image download fails or is slow | No internet connection or DNS issues | Check device network connectivity |
| Container restarts repeatedly | Insufficient memory | Memory Limit should be at least `1GB` |

### 4. AI Model Management

Go to the **AI Models** page to view loaded model running status and inference frame rate. Click a model card for detailed information (ID, version, load time, model path, associated applications).

![](https://resources.camthink.ai/wiki/img/neoeyes-ne503-series/quick-start/qs-ai-models.png)

## System Integration

### 1. Video Stream Integration

The NE503 RTSP streams follow standard protocols and can be connected directly to mainstream NVR / VMS platforms (NX Witness / Milestone / Genetec) or pulled using FFmpeg / GStreamer. Recommendation: use the main stream for recording, the sub stream for live preview, and the third stream for AI analysis.

### 2. API Integration

The NE503 provides a RESTful API for programmatic management and data retrieval. All endpoints require Bearer Token authentication:

```bash
# Login to get Token
curl -X POST http://<device-ip>:8080/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"<your-password>"}'

# Query device information
curl http://<device-ip>:8080/api/v1/system/info \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

| Module | Path Prefix | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| System | `/api/v1/system` | Device info, reboot, OTA upgrade |
| Media | `/api/v1/media` | Video parameters, OSD, AI overlay |
| Device | `/api/v1/device` | PTZ, lens, GPIO control |
| Applications | `/api/v1/apps` | Application lifecycle management |
| Storage | `/api/v1/storage` | Disk management |

### 3. Event Bus Integration

AI inference results and device alerts are output as structured events through the Event Bus, supporting MQTT subscription and publish/subscribe patterns for real-time integration with business systems.
