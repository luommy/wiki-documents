# Quick Start

Complete: power and connection → password change → camera and stream check → AI demo → network setup.

## 1. Prepare

| Item | Requirement |
|:--|:--|
| Power | PoE 802.3AT or DC 12V |
| Network | Switch, Ethernet cable, and a computer with configurable Ethernet IP |
| Browser | Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari |

IP67 rated, -40 °C to +60 °C operating temperature, 5–6 W power consumption. Use a matching wall-mount or other mounting bracket.

## 2. Power and Connect

PoE: connect the Ethernet cable to a PoE switch. DC: connect a 12V adapter to the DC port. Proceed when the LED is solid (about 30–60 seconds).

The factory IP is `10.0.0.1`. Set the computer to the same subnet, for example `10.0.0.100/24`, then run:

~~~bash
ping 10.0.0.1
~~~

A reply confirms the connection. If it fails, check power, cable, computer IP, and firewall. If the device has joined DHCP, look up its new address in the router.

## 3. Log In and Change the Password

Open `https://10.0.0.1` and sign in with `admin` / `password`.

Open **Settings → Device Info → Change Password**, set a new password, and save it.

> The device has no local password-reset function. A forgotten password requires support-assisted reflashing.

## 4. Verify the Camera and Stream

Open **Media**. A live image confirms the camera pipeline.

Enable **Enable RTSP Stream** and open this URL in VLC:

~~~text
rtsp://<device-ip>:8554/main
~~~

Successful playback confirms streaming. For a black screen or stutter, confirm the setting was saved and use TCP transport in the player.

## 5. Run the AI Demo

Download and extract [model-showcase-latest-arm64.tar.gz](https://github.com/camthink-ai/neoruntime-apps/releases/download/showcase-bundles-latest/model-showcase-latest-arm64.tar.gz):

~~~bash
tar xzf model-showcase-latest-arm64.tar.gz
~~~

Open **Applications → Import → Upload Package**, select `app.yaml` and `image.tar`, grant the required model and stream permissions, and click **Install**.

Source, SDK, and build resources are listed in [Resources](./4-application-guide/3-resources.md).

## 6. Configure Network and Time Zone

Open **Settings → Network**, select DHCP or Static Address, and save. Reconnect to the device at its new IP.

Open **Settings → Time Settings**, select the time zone, configure NTP, and click **Sync Now**.
